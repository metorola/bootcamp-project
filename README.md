An online food ordering Platform

A friend of mine just started a restaurant, she wants me to build a platform where people can order for food online.
I am required to build a minimum viable product(MVP) that carries out the following operations: ●Creates a food.●Read all foods created.●Read a single food.●Update a food.●Delete a food.●Order for food.●Read all ordered food.
